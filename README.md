# Input

The vast majority of efficient input comes from typing on the keyboard.

Learn the keyboard shortcuts, focusing on the ones that you will use the most using the below Keyboard Reference Sheets.

This guide uses the Windows keyboard shortcuts.

## Keyboard Reference Sheets

These are the official Microsoft PDF files:

* Linux: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=832144
* MacOS: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=832143

## Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts

## Fonts and Font Ligatures

You can set your own custom font (for any installed font) and whether to use _font ligatures_ or not in the __Settings__ page.

Ligatures make it so things like `!=` `==` and `===` render properly. Fonts __must__ support ligatures for it to take effect.

For all coding I personally recommend using the font Iosevka:
https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka

Make sure that font installed and appears on an OS level first.

On the settings page use the search bar to search for `Editor: Font Family`.

For the `Editor: Font Family` result type in `Iosevka, sans-serif`.

For the `Terminal â€º Integrated: Font Family` result type in `Iosevka Term, monospace`.

## Tab Size

On the settings page use the search bar to search for `Editor: Tab Size`.

For the `Editor: Tab Size` result set it to your liking. I recommend `4`.

## Rendering Whitespace

On the settings page use the search bar to search for `Editor: Render Whitespace`.

For the `Editor: Render Whitespace` result set it to your liking. I recommend `all`.

* Press `Ctrl+F`
* Type in the search string
* Press `Enter` to jump to the first result found

## Find and Replace

To replace one or all occurences of a string within the current document:

* Press `Ctrl+H`
* In the __first__ field type in the string to find
* In the __second__ field type in the string to replace with
* Press `Enter` to perform one replacement __OR__ `Ctrl+Alt+Enter` to replace all occurences

### Regular Expression Replaces

Regular expressions are powerful and allow for:

* Prefixing
* Suffixing
* Pattern Matching

While the replace dialog is active press `Alt+R` to toggle regular expressions on or off.

#### Prefixing

To add a string to the beginning of each line.

Note: `(.*)` means "zero or more characters" and `$1` means "the entire line".

E.g. to prefix `TEXT-`:

* Press `Ctrl+H`
* In the __first__ field type in `(.*)`
* In the __second__ field type in the string `TEXT-$1`
* Press `Enter` to perform one replacement __OR__ `Ctrl+Alt+Enter` to replace all occurences

#### Suffixing

To add a string to the end of each line.

Note: `(.*)` means "zero or more characters" and `$1` means "the entire line".

E.g. to suffix `.zip`:

* Press `Ctrl+H`
* In the __first__ field type in `(.*)`
* In the __second__ field type in the string `$1.zip`
* Press `Enter` to perform one replacement __OR__ `Ctrl+Alt+Enter` to replace all occurences

#### Pattern Matching

Note: `(.*)` means "zero or more characters".

To replace all lines that contain `A1` with `paper`:
* Press `Ctrl+H`
* In the __first__ field type in `(.*)A1(.*)`
* In the __second__ field type in the string `paper`
* Press `Enter` to perform one replacement __OR__ `Ctrl+Alt+Enter` to replace all occurences
