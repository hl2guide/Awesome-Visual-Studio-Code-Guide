# Input

The vast majority of efficient input comes from typing on the keyboard.

Learn the keyboard shortcuts, focusing on the ones that you will use the most using the below Keyboard Reference Sheets.

This guide uses the Windows keyboard shortcuts.

## Keyboard Reference Sheets

These are the official Microsoft PDF files:

# Configuration

## Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts

To set your own keyboard shortcuts press `Ctrl+K` then `Ctrl+S`.

## Fonts and Font Ligatures

You can set your own custom font (for any installed font) and whether to use _font ligatures_ or not in the __Settings__ page.

Ligatures make it so things like `!=` `==` and `===` render properly. Fonts __must__ support ligatures for it to take effect.

For all coding I personally recommend using the font Iosevka:

Make sure that font installed and appears on an OS level first.

On the settings page use the search bar to search for `Editor: Font Family`.

For the `Editor: Font Family` result type in `Iosevka, sans-serif`.

For the `Terminal â€º Integrated: Font Family` result type in `Iosevka Term, monospace`.

## Tab Size

On the settings page use the search bar to search for `Editor: Tab Size`.

For the `Editor: Tab Size` result set it to your liking. I recommend `4`.

## Rendering Whitespace

On the settings page use the search bar to search for `Editor: Render Whitespace`.

For the `Editor: Render Whitespace` result set it to your liking. I recommend `all`.

# Editor

To add cursors at arbitrary positions, select a position with your mouse and use `Alt+Click`.

To set cursors above or below the current position press `Ctrl+Alt+Up` or `Ctrl+Alt+Down`

You can add additional cursors to all occurrences of the current selection by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+L`.

## Fast Scrolling

To fast scroll press and hold `alt` and then press `up` or `down` or use your mouse wheel.

To resume normal scrolling simply release the `alt` key.

Press `Shift+Alt+F` to format an entire document.

## Code Folding

When working with a large document folding (collapsing) sections of code is really useful to focus on a particular section.

* Press `Ctrl+Shift+[` to fold selected lines.

For documents that support IntelliSense you can use `Ctrl+Space` while coding to get suggestions for method names, parameters etc.
